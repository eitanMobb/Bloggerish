# Security Rules for Mobb Vulnerability Scanning

## MANDATORY: Mobb Scan Protocol
**CRITICAL**: After implementing any new features or making code changes, before committing anything to the repo, you MUST:
1. **ALWAYS run Mobb scan after implementation**: Use `mcp_mobb-mcp_scan_and_fix_vulnerabilities` tool to scan the new/modified code
2. **Add security rules**: For EVERY fix produced by Mobb, no matter which Mobb tool was used, add a new generic security rule to a separate rule file in `.cursor/rules/` to prevent the vulnerability type from recurring
3. **Document the process**: Always explain what security measures were taken and any vulnerabilities found

## Rule Addition Protocol
When Mobb produces a fix:
- Extract the vulnerability type (e.g., "Command Injection", "SQL Injection", "XSS")
- Create a generic prevention rule for that vulnerability type
- **If rule file exists**: Add new information to the existing `.cursor/rules/[vulnerability-type].mdc` file
- **If rule file doesn't exist**: Create a new rule file: `.cursor/rules/[vulnerability-type].mdc` (e.g., `command-injection.mdc`)
- Add the rule with clear, actionable guidance and `alwaysApply: true`
- Make the rule specific enough to prevent the issue but generic enough to apply broadly
- Update the main security.mdc to reference the rule file (if it's new)

### CRITICAL: Rule File Update Requirements
When updating an existing rule file:
- **NEVER replace existing content** - always append new information
- **Maintain existing format and structure** - follow the same markdown formatting, bullet points, and organization
- **Preserve all existing rules and examples** - only add new information
- **Update metadata appropriately** - increment version numbers, update dates, add new status entries
- **Ensure consistency** - new content should match the existing style and tone

## Active Security Rules

## Enforcement
- This rule is ALWAYS APPLIED and cannot be bypassed
- Any AI assistant that fails to follow this protocol should be corrected immediately
- Team members should verify that security scans are run before code reviews

## ⚠️ CRITICAL CHECKLIST FOR AI ASSISTANTS ⚠️
**BEFORE completing any coding task, verify you have:**
- [ ] Run Mobb security scan on new/modified code
- [ ] Applied ALL security fixes provided by Mobb
- [ ] Created/updated vulnerability-specific rule files (**APPEND-ONLY** - never replace existing content)
- [ ] **UPDATED THIS security.mdc file to reference new rule files**
- [ ] Documented all security measures taken
- [ ] **Verified that existing rule content was preserved and only new information was added**

**FAILURE TO COMPLETE ANY OF THESE STEPS IS A SECURITY VIOLATION**
